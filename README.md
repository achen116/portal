# Passion Project


## Description

My passion project is inspired by a real challenge I have witnessed through my oldest sister. She is a supermom of three kids, who not so surprisingly have a lot of stuff. While the family's purchases are a necessary investment, my sister’s kids quickly outgrow them in a matter of months. Now, my sister is not only accumulating baby products around her home, but also buying new ones to fit the needs of her growing children. This vicious cycle motivated the idea of building a marketplace for moms and dads to buy, sell, or trade their baby’s items to other parents in need.

The marketplace I envision would kick off locally, allowing parents to schedule convenient in-person exchanges or to mail items. It would encourage a rating system, asking users to leave feedback on the quality of the product, as well as the ease of the transaction. It could even expand to potentially support a point system, providing users with the opportunity to accrue redeemable points on merchandise for sale. The intention of creating this space is to not only benefit parents hoping to clear more space in their homes without losing out on their investments, but also parents seeking to purchase apparel, books, and other goods (large or small) at an affordable cost. I believe this project has the capacity to offer all parents a positive and easy solution to fulfilling the purchasing needs of their families.
